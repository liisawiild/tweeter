# Tweeter Project üê•

This single-page application (SPA) is a clone of Twitter/X, called Tweeter.

This project provided the opportunity to work with newly learned HTML, CSS, SASS, jQuery and AJAX, and continue to develop JS, Node, and Express back-end skills. 

Features to Highlight:
- Use of media queries to create attractive responsive design for larger or smaller screens
- Timeago library used to format the timestamp on posted tweets
- Character counter and corresponding error messages
- Aesthetic choice of profile image background
- Use of jQuery to toggle the new tweet container on and off the page
- Hover features (cursor pointer, shadows)

Stretch Features to highlight:
- "Write a new tweet" button in the navbar toggles the new tweet container in and out of view
- SASS was partially used to streamline use of primary and secondary fonts and colors
